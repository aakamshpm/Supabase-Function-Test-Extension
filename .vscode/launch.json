// This configuration is for launching a VS Code extension in development mode.
// It specifies the extension development path and the output files to watch.
// The `preLaunchTask` ensures that the TypeScript files are compiled before launching the extension.
// To run this configuration, you can use the Run and Debug panel in VS Code.
// The `args` array can be modified to include additional command-line arguments for the extension host.
// The `outFiles` pattern matches the compiled JavaScript files in the `out` directory of the workspace folder.
// The `name` field is used to identify this configuration in the Run and Debug panel.
// The `type` field specifies that this is an extension host configuration.
// The `request` field indicates that this is a launch request, meaning it will start the extension host process.
